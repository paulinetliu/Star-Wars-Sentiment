# Star-Wars-Sentiment

This project was my first introduction to natural language processing, and I found the task challenging and rewarding. Lists of positive and negative words 
were used to calculate the sentiment score for each line in the original Star Wars. Each positive word added one point to the score, and each negative word subtracted one point. I challenged myself to not use any libraries in this project, so I could become more familiar with lists and dictionaries. I then created some visualizations based on the sentiment scores for each line and other characteristics, such as their place in the movie or which character is speaking them. I've always been interested in filmmaking and screenwriting, so this project was quite interesting and enjoyable.
